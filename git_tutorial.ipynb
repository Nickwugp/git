This contains a compressed snapshot of the contents of the file when the commit happened (blob is short for binary large object, which is a SQL database term for \"may contain data of any kind\"). In the middle commit, `report.md` and `draft.md` were changed, so the blobs are shown next to that commit. `data/northern.csv` didn't change in that commit, so the tree links to the blob from the previous commit.
